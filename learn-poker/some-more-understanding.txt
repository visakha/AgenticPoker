Texas Hold'em Poker Rules - Complete Reference
Overview
Texas Hold'em is a poker variant where players create the best 5-card hand using 2 private "hole" cards and 5 shared "community" cards through strategic betting across 4 rounds.

Amount: Typically half the big blind
Example: $5 in a $5/$10 game
Big Blind: Player immediately left of small blind
Amount: Minimum bet for the table

Showdown Rules
When Showdown Occurs
2+ players remain after final betting round
Players reveal cards to determine best hand
Order of Showing
Last aggressor: Player who bet/raised last shows first
If no betting: Player left of dealer button shows first, then clockwise
Mucking: Players can fold without showing if beaten
Winning
Best 5-card hand wins using any combination of:
Both hole cards
One hole card + 4 community cards
No hole cards (playing the board)
Special Situations
All Players Fold Except One
Result: Remaining player wins entire pot immediately
No showdown: Winner doesn't need to show cards
Chips: Winner's stack increases by pot amount
All-In Situations
All-In: Player bets all remaining chips
Status: Player becomes "all-in" and can't bet further
Showdown: All-in players still compete for pot
Side Pots
When Created: When player(s) go all-in but others continue betting
Main Pot: All chips up to all-in player's contribution
All-in player only eligible for main pot
Side Pot(s): Additional bets by players with remaining chips
Only players who contributed can win side pot
Multiple Side Pots: Created when multiple players all-in at different amounts
Award Order: Main pot first, then side pots
Table Positions (9-Handed)
Understanding position is crucial in poker. Your strategy should change based on where you sit relative to the dealer button.

Position Names (Clockwise from Dealer)
Dealer/Button (BTN): Acts last post-flop (most powerful position)
Small Blind (SB): Left of button, posts small blind
Big Blind (BB): Left of SB, posts big blind
Under The Gun (UTG): Left of BB, first to act pre-flop
Early Position (EP): Next 2 seats after UTG
Middle Position (MP): Next 2 seats after EP
Cutoff (CO): Right of button (second-best position)
Strategic Position Play
General Rule: The more players left to act after you, the tighter you should play.

UTG (Under The Gun)
Strategy: Very tight range
Why: Many players left to act who could raise
Hands: Premium hands only (AA, KK, QQ, AK)
Early Position
Strategy: Still tight, slightly wider than UTG
Adjustment: Tighten if players behind are aggressive
Middle Position
Strategy: More freedom, ~50% of table folded
Hands: Add small pairs and suited connectors
Cutoff
Strategy: Powerful position, wide opening range
Why: Only button and blinds left to act
Advantage: Will have position on blinds if called
Button (Dealer)
Strategy: Widest opening range
Why: Acts last on all post-flop streets
Profit: Most winnings come from button play
Advantage: Maximum information before acting
Blinds (SB/BB)
Reality: Will lose money from blinds (even pros)
Why: Worst position (act first post-flop)
Strategy: Play premium hands and set-mining hands only
Disadvantage: Positional disadvantage too great to overcome
Poker Terminology
Essential Terms
Action: Any check, call, fold, or raise. Also describes games with lots of betting.

Ante: Forced bet made pre-flop in addition to blinds. Can be paid by everyone or just UTG+1/button (straddle).

All-In: Committing all remaining chips to the pot.

Check: Declining to bet while staying in the hand (only when no bet has been made).

Community Cards: The 5 shared cards (flop, turn, river) used with hole cards to make best hand.

Draw: An unmade hand that could improve (e.g., 4 cards to a flush).

Fold: Discarding your hand and forfeiting the pot.

Gutshot: Inside straight draw (e.g., 8-7 on K-5-4 needs a 6).

Heads-Up: A pot contested by only 2 players.

Hole Cards: Your 2 private cards dealt face-down.

Kicker: Highest unpaired side card used to break ties.

Example: A♠Q♥ vs A♦J♣ on A♥-9♦-4♣-2♥-8♣
Both have pair of aces, but Q-kicker wins
Muck: Pile of discarded cards. To muck = discard without showing.

Nuts: The strongest possible hand that cannot be beaten.

Can be royal flush, ace-high straight/flush, or even top set
Overcard: Card higher than any community card.

Example: K♣Q♣ on 5♦6♠8♣ = two overcards
Tilt: Emotional state causing suboptimal play.

Three-Bet: Re-raising a raise (first raise = bet, second raise = three-bet).

Straddle: Optional blind (usually 2x big blind) posted by UTG+1 or button.

 Hand rankings via hand_evaluator
 Showdown logic with hand comparison
 All players fold scenario (just fixed!)
 Chip management (bets deducted, pot accumulated, winner awarded)
 Player statuses (ACTIVE, FOLDED, ALL_IN)
⚠️ Needs Verification/Improvement
 Blind posting: Are blinds actually posted at start of hand?
 First to act pre-flop: Should be UTG (left of big blind)
 First to act post-flop: Should be first active player left of button
 Dealer button rotation: Does button move after each hand?
 Blind amounts: Are small/big blind amounts configurable and correct?
 Minimum raise: Is minimum raise enforced (at least 2x current bet)?
 All-in handling: Are all-in players properly excluded from further betting?
 Kicker comparison: Detailed tiebreaker logic for identical hands
❌ Not Implemented (Advanced Features)
 Side pots: Multiple pots when players all-in at different amounts
 Pot splitting: Equal division when hands tie
 Antes: Optional forced bets in addition to blinds
 Straddles: Optional blind posted by non-blind positions
 Position tracking: UTG, EP, MP, CO labels for strategic play
 Betting limits: No-limit, pot-limit, fixed-limit structures
 Minimum bet enforcement: Ensuring bets meet table minimums
 String betting prevention: Raise must be declared/done in one motion
 Muck option: Allow players to fold without showing at showdown
Critical Rules for Correct Implementation
1. Betting Round Completion
A betting round ends when:

All active players have acted
All active players have matched the current bet
Only one player remains (others folded)
2. Hand Termination
A hand ends when:

Only one player remains (all others folded) → Winner gets pot immediately
Final betting round complete → Showdown determines winner
All players all-in → Deal remaining cards, then showdown
3. Chip Flow
Bets: Deducted from player chips immediately
Pot: Accumulates all bets
Winner: Pot added to winner's chips
Losers: Already lost their bets (no further deduction)
4. Player Status Transitions
ACTIVE → FOLDED (when player folds)
ACTIVE → ALL_IN (when player bets all chips)
ALL_IN → stays ALL_IN until showdown
FOLDED → stays FOLDED until new hand
5. Action Order
Pre-flop: Starts with UTG (left of big blind), goes clockwise
Post-flop: Starts with first active player left of button, goes clockwise
Button advantage: Acts last on all post-flop streets
Next Steps for Implementation
Verify blind posting in game initialization
Fix action order for pre-flop (UTG first) and post-flop (left of button first)
Test dealer button rotation between hands
Implement side pots for all-in scenarios
Add pot splitting for tied hands with kicker comparison
Improve showdown card reveal order
Add betting validation (minimums, raises, etc.)
Track positions (UTG, EP, MP, CO) for strategic analysis
Add antes/straddles as optional features
